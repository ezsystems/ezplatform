# Solr config, to be appended after base-prod or base-dev, ..., but before selenium.yml
#
# NOTE: You'll need to manually reindex the solr index when booting this as we don't have entrypoint for solr yet.
#       (Unless you use ezplatform:install command which indexes for you)

## WARNING!
# This service is currently work in progress, is not tested by CI, and thus not guaranteed to work.
# You are however more then welcome to try it out and help make it stable.
