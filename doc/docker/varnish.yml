## DEBUG??
# In need of debugging all request going to Varnish, use varnishlog, example:
#   docker-compose exec varnish varnishlog -c -i ReqURL,ReqMethod -I ReqHeader:xkey
#  Or more relevant only PURGE's with all info:
#   docker-compose exec varnish varnishlog -g request -q "ReqMethod eq 'PURGE'"
#
#  But before doing that check that http and not local purge client is set:
#   docker-compose exec app bin/console --env=dev debug:container ezplatform.http_cache.purge_client_internal
#
# And if in prod make sure you have rebuilt app container on code changes ;)
