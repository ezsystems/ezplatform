    ## eZ Platform/Symfony ENVIRONMENT variables, for customizing index.php* execution
    # * Only APP_ENV and APP_DEBUG supported by console command, rest are eZ Platform features in index.php.

    # Environment.
    # Possible values: "prod" and "dev" out-of-the-box, other values possible with proper configuration
    # Defaults to "prod" if omitted (uses SetEnvIf so value can be used in rewrite rules)
    #if[APP_ENV] SetEnvIf Request_URI ".*" APP_ENV=%APP_ENV%

    # Optional: Whether to use debugging.
    # Possible values: 0, 1 or ""
    # Defaults to enabled if APP_ENV is set to "dev" if env value is omitted or empty
    #if[APP_DEBUG] SetEnv APP_DEBUG "%APP_DEBUG%"

    # Optional: Whether to use Symfony's builtin HTTP Caching Proxy.
    # Disable it if you are using an external reverse proxy (e.g. Varnish)
    # Possible values: 0, 1 or ""
    # Defaults to disabled if APP_ENV is set to "dev" or TRUSTED_PROXIES is set,
    # and if this env value is omitted or empty
    #if[APP_HTTP_CACHE] SetEnv APP_HTTP_CACHE "%APP_HTTP_CACHE%"

    # Optional: Defines the proxies to trust
    # Needed when using Varnish as proxy, if so disable APP_HTTP_CACHE.
    # Separate entries by a comma, example: "ip1,ip2"
    # Defaults to not be set if env value is omitted or empty

    # TIP: There are many more environment variables supported by eZ Platform. However unlike those listed above
    #      they should in most cases rather be set in the environment then in vhost config to make sure cronjobs
    #      and cli command usage takes them into account as well.
