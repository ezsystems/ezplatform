# All user specific files from now on should be kept in the global .gitignore file
# located in the user's local environment. To do so you have to inform Git which
# files should be excluded globally (for every Git repository).
#
# Here is a short instruction about how to exclude selected files globally:
#
# - create a new .gitignore file in your home folder:
#   touch ~/.gitignore
#
# - add some exclusions, eg:
#   /nbproject/
#   /.idea/
#
# - inform Git where it should start looking for .gitignore file:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
#
# More details about excluding specific file on your local environment can be found
# in the official GitHub article: https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/
