# This file describes an application. You can have multiple applications
# in the same project.

# Please see doc/platformsh/README.md and doc/platformsh/INSTALL.md
# NB: Clustered eZ Platform setups are not tested and are likely to have issues.

# The name of this app. Must be unique within a project.
name: app

dependencies:
    nodejs:

# The type of the application to build.
type: php:7.3
build:
    # "none" means we're running composer manually, see build hook
    flavor: "none"

# The relationships of the application with services or other applications.
# The left-hand side is the name of the relationship as it will be exposed
# to the application in the PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS variable. The right-hand
# side is in the form `<service name>:<endpoint name>`.
relationships:
    database: 'mysqldb:user'
    # Uncomment if you want to store dfs tables in a separate database:
    #dfs_database: 'mysqldb:dfs'
    rediscache: 'rediscache:redis'
    # If you wish to have a separate Redis instance for sessions, uncomment
    # this relationship and the corresponding service in .platform/services.yaml
    #redissession: 'redissession:redis'
    # If you wish to use solr, uncomment this relationship and the corresponding service in .platform/services.yaml
